EXAMPLES:

Force delete a machine (by UUID, IPv4, MAC, or hostname):
    $ nico-admin-cli machine force-delete --machine 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567

Force delete a machine and its interfaces (redeploy kea afterward):
    $ nico-admin-cli machine force-delete --machine 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567 \
    --delete-interfaces

Force delete a DPU and drop its device-identity binding so it re-keys on next discovery:
    $ nico-admin-cli machine force-delete --machine 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567 \
    --delete-device-identity
