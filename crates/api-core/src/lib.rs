//!
//! The Carbide API server implementation.
//!
//! This crate holds the [`Api`] service (the gRPC `Forge` implementation and all
//! the business logic behind it), plus the server bootstrap ([`run`]) and the
//! request listener. The admin web UI lives in the separate `carbide-api-web`
//! crate, which depends on this one; the thin `carbide-api` binary crate wires
//! the two together.

// It's too cumbersome for tests to adhere to these, which are less important in testing anyway.
// The `test_support` module also compiles when a dependent enables the `test-support` feature, so
// the allow must cover that build too; otherwise the custom txn lints fire on shared test helpers
// under `--all-features`.
#![cfg_attr(any(test, feature = "test-support"), allow(txn_held_across_await))]
#![cfg_attr(any(test, feature = "test-support"), allow(txn_without_commit))]

// NOTE on pub vs non-pub mods:
//
// Most of this crate is private ("mod", not "pub mod"), so that we get working dead-code detection:
// If modules here are public, rust will not find dead code for anything marked `pub` within the
// module. We make public only the minimum surface needed by our two dependents:
//   - the `carbide-api` binary crate, which needs `run`, `init_tools`, and the listener wiring; and
//   - the `carbide-api-web` crate, which needs the `Api` service type and a few shared types
//     (`AuthContext`, `CarbideError`, `LogStream`/`LogLine`, `NUM_REQUIRED_APPROVALS`, and the
//     `cfg::file` config types).
// Anything that doesn't need to cross a crate boundary should stay private.
